## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- **Clear and concise** - Avoid jargon when possible

- **Consistent** - Follow existing formatting

### Formatting Standards

#### Headers
```markdown
# Main Title (H1 - one per file)
## Section (H2)
### Subsection (H3)
```

#### Code Blocks
Use fenced code blocks with language hints:
```markdown
```sql
SELECT * FROM table
```
```

#### Tables
Use markdown tables for structured information:
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |
```

#### Links
Use relative links for internal navigation:
```markdown
[Link Text](../path/to/file.md)
```

### File Organization

- Place files in appropriate directories
- Use numbered prefixes for ordering (01-, 02-, etc.)
- Keep filenames lowercase with hyphens
- Include README.md in each directory
