## Key Principles

### 1. Data Flows Left to Right
Workflows should be readable like a sentence - data enters on the left and results exit on the right.

### 2. Each Tool Does One Thing
Tools are designed to do one thing well. Combine them to build complex processes.

### 3. Metadata Matters
Understanding your data's structure (fields, types, sizes) is as important as the data itself.

### 4. Test Early, Test Often
Use Browse tools and the Results window to verify data at each step.
